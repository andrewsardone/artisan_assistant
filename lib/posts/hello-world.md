Hi there. Welcome to Artisan Assistant. This blog post lays out the project,
what I'm building, and why. Enjoy!

## What is this?

Artisan Assitant is the simplest way for a tattoo shop to manage information
about its customers. The technical term is a "CRM," if that means anything to
you. Most CRM systems are incredibly complicated. AA, as I like to call it,
isn't.

The quick summary is: you sign up, you put in your customer's information, and
you can quickly find a customer's phone number from their name, or see who's
on your waiting list. Stuff like that.

I originally created the first version of Artisan Assitant to help [Artisan
Tattoo](http://artisanpittsburgh.com/) manage [Jason
Angst](http://artisanpittsburgh.com/tattoo/jason-angst/bioportfolio/)'s
waitlist. He's got a long one, because he's an amazing artist. I should know,
he did my sleeve. :)

Anyway, over the past year or so, Artisan has been using my prototype, and
it's worked well. So now I'm building the next version as a product that
you can use to help run your own shop.

However, it's not ready yet. I'm still working on it. But I like to make
things public as early as possible. Soon!

## Who are you?

I'm [Steve Klabnik](http://twitter.com/steveklabnik). I write a lot of
software, and love getting tattoos. If you know what "Ruby on Rails" is,
I help make that. If not, don't worry about it.

## Why do it this way?

This part is more for any programmers reading, so don't worry if you're not
one.

There aren't enough open source Rails applications in the world, and so I
wanted to build an actual, real-world product that I'm charging money for in
Rails, so that you can see how I do it. This isn't some fake program that I'm
using to illustrate a point: It's 100% real. I'm hoping to help my friends make
some money, earn a little bit of (mostly) passive income to help pay for my
student loans, and show you how I build Rails apps.

I'm starting from almost nothing: the index page for this blog isn't even there
yet! The commit in which this blog post gets deployed will be the 13th commit
in the entire history, so you're seeing it nice and raw. No secrets here!

Oh: for now, this app is purely Rails, but I hope to replace the front-end with
[Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) soon. My Ember chops aren't yet to the point
where I'm comfortable doing an MVP in Ember, so I'm doing it second. If I was
better at Ember, I'd just start off that way.

Oh, and everything is [AGPL'd](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html). If you
want to use any of the code under a different license, [email
me](mailto:steve@steveklabnik.com) and I'll probably let you have it under
BSD/MIT. Probably.

I also plan on blogging each 'working day' about what exactly I did and why.
I'm hoping that this will be better than making epic commit messages, though
I'm gonna try to make good ones. Sometimes you have to talk about things
across commits, and commit messages just aren't a blogging platform.

## So, let's begin.

Soon, you'll be able to go to
[http://www.artisanassistant.com](http://www.artisanassistant.com) and
actually use it, but until then, if you're a programmer, you can
watch my progress here. I'll have an RSS feed up soon. You can also
[check out the source on
GitHub](https://github.com/artisan-tattoo/artisan_assistant).

Let's enjoy the ride!
